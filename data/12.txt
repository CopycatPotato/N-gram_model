Take my mind and take my pain,
Empty bottle takes the rain
And heal, heal, heal, heal

Take my past and take my sins
Like an empty sail takes the wind
And heal, heal, heal, heal

And tell me some things last
And tell me some things last

Take my heart and take my hand
Like an ocean takes the dirty sands
And heal, heal, heal, heal

Take my mind and take my pain,
Empty bottle takes the rain
And heal, heal, heal, heal

And tell me some things last
And tell me some things last
And tell me some things last
And tell me some things last
