A coffee stain on a window sill
A bad translation to a foreign film
Or just wondering round with you
Just wondering town with you
Would be enough

The tiny cracks on the city stone
A welcome back to your troubled home
Or just wondering round with you
Just wondering town with you
Would be enough

But
I didn't see the sea until I crossed
And I didn't feel your love until I lost

The moving shadows on your swaying light
Or you picture notes of porcupines
Or just wondering round with you
Just wondering town with you
Would be enough

But
I didn't see the sea until I crossed
And I didn't feel your love until I lost
